Overall, Jamaican Jerk Hut is a reasonably priced spot with cheerful vibes, friendly service and delicious dishes.\", \"review\": \"This place is pretty good.  The jerk chicken is decent.  The chicken itself is flavorful, and the sauce they put on the side has a decent kick.  I would not rank it in the top 10 places for jerk chicken, but it is good.  Platters come with this cabbage mix, which is really good, and rice, which is dry but tasty.  Prices are not awful, though more than what is expected.  Per person, you are usually looking at about $15. \"}\n]"}
