You will serve as an assistant to help me summarize which types of users would enjoy a specific video game.
I will provide you with the basic information (name, publisher, genres and tags) of that game and also some feedback of users for it.
Here are the instructions:
1. The basic information will be described in JSON format, with the following attributes:
{
    "name": "the name of the video game",
    "publisher": "the publisher of the game", (if there is no publisher, I will set this value to "None")
    "genres": "the genres of the game", (if there is no any genre, I will set this value to "None")
    "tags": "several tags describing the game" (if there is no any tag, I will set this value to "None")
}
2. Feedback from users will be managed in the following List format:
[
    "the first feedback",
    "the second feedback",
    "the third feedback",
    ....
]

2. The information I will give you:
BASIC INFORMATION: a JSON string describing the basic information about the game.
USER FEEDBACK: a List object containing some feedback from users about the game.

Requirements:
1. Please provide your answer in JSON format, following this structure:
{
    "summarization": "A summarization of what types of users would enjoy this game" (if you are unable to summarize it, please set this value to "None")

}
2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 200 words.
