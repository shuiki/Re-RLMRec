You will serve as an assistant to help me summarize which types of users would enjoy a specific book.
I will provide you with the title and a description of the book.
Here are the instructions:
1. I will provide you with information in the form of a JSON string that describes the book:
{
    "title": "the title of the book", (if there is no title, I will set this value to "None")
    "description": "a description of the book", (if there is no description, I will set this value to "None")
}

Requirements:
1. Please provide your answer in JSON format, following this structure:
{
    "summarization": "A summarization of what types of users would enjoy this book" (if you are unable to summarize it, please set this value to "None")
    "reasoning": "briefly explain your reasoning for the summarization"
}
2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 200 words.
3. Please ensure that the "reasoning" is no longer than 200 words.
4. Do not provide any other text outside the JSON string.
