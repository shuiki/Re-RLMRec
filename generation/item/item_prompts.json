{"prompt": "BASIC INFORMATION: \n{\"name\": \"Upland Carmel Tap House\", \"city\": \"Carmel\", \"categories\": \"\\\"Nightlife, Food, Bars, Breweries, Pizza, Brewpubs, Pubs, Restaurants\\\"\"}\nUSER FEEDBACK: \n[\n\"I go hear often for lunch because it is near my office, so this will be review for a lunch spot.  I drink enough after work to start knocking back craft beer at lunch:)   They do a great job with the food here.  Not a huge menu, but they seem to pack a lot of uniqueness to their menu.  I really liked the bison chili and the steak salad I had on recent visit.  My coworkers turkey sandwiches looked great and I hear the burgers are excellent.  Not the place for someone on strict lunch budget, a little pricey.   I will be back often and have visited 3 times in the last 6 weeks or so.  Cheers.\"\n\"Sunday $2 pints!  I really like this place for a Sunday mellow.  It's kid friendly.  I like the minimal number of TVs and they have a friendly, attentive staff.  The nachos and fish and chips are solid!  They also have decent vegetarian options.  Outdoor seating is ample.  Any out of town guests I've taken have had purely positive comments.\"\n\"I realize as I begin to write this review that I have been a bad Yelper.  I'm writing this because of a less than stellar experience on a single visit.  That's not fair to Upland Carmel Tap House.  So let me start back last summer circa 2013. In reality I've been here two dozen or so times for lunch...the bartender knows us. My friends and I always sit at the bar and we even shoot the breeze with the staff because they see us a lot! We are \"Mug Club Members\" and I re-upped my membership for 2014. Long story longer...I know the food, the beer and the staff. I L-O-V-E this place. It has good food and great beer! Come here. Visit this place. Spend time and relax with some friends here on the patio or at the bar. You will not be disappointed.Ok, so now that I have given my props I want to discuss the issue with my visit today for lunch.  I met a friend and sat at the bar to be served by Molly. Molly is great! She is friendly, customer oriented and just a very nice and talented person who genuinely seems concerned for her customers.I'm a creature of habit and if you follow me then you already know this. I always get the same thing here because it is epic. I always order a bison philly. Think of a burger made w/bison instead of beef and topped with provolone, mushrooms & onions. Today I ordered a side of bison chili instead of fries. I've been told by several servers at Upland that bison is a less fatty meat compared to beef so when ordering it I should dial it back a little on the temperature. I like a hot pink center so I've been advised each time before to order it medium so I did. Before I go on I want to say that this is the same order I've made a couple dozen times. I've ordered this same sandwich so often that the bartender asks me if I want the usual. Each time I have ordered it I have received a sandwich with a nicely moist hot pink center.This is NOT what I received this time.  I cut the sandwich in half as I usually do since this \"burger\" is BIG! When i cut this one in half it was reddish pink and was bleeding. The juices that poured out of the cut meat soaked the bun and turned it red because the juices were in fact bloody.  I was not upset. I was not angry. I have worked fine dining myself. I have worked fast food. I have worked casual dining. I have worked quick service. I have tended bar at multiple venues from restaurants to hotels to college bars and everything in between.  This happens occasionally. Every once in a while a sandwich isn't perfect...no big deal.  I asked Molly if i could get one just a shade more done.  Again, if you follow me then you know I'm not too picky so this must have been...bloody.  She apologized and took it back to the kitchen. I have to say that there was no reason for an apology, but Molly has great customer service skills so she did what comes naturally to her.  I waited and chatted with my friend...I even stole a few fries from her so I was good!  Then it happened.The cook (I assume) comes out of the back. Curly dark haired guy wearing a black Upland shirt and an apron. He asks me if there was a problem with the food and he was carrying my plate with the Bison Philly cut in half still on it. I say yes. He asked if I ordered it medium and I respond yes again.  He then goes on to tell me that he \"doesn't want people to think this isn't medium because it is.\" I say okay. He then asks me if I want it prepared \"Well\" and \"put back on.\"  I say yes again. I assume my face was a storm cloud by then because he turned and left abruptly. Molly came by and apologized again. The 2nd burger was cooked thru and charred a bit on the outside...I ate it as I had to get going and didn't want a 2nd visit from curly.My friend and I had the WTF discussion and then told Molly about it. We even told her we were fine and not upset at all until the guy came out and told us we were incorrect and that I received what I ordered so the error was all mine.So let's discuss. Should a medium prepared piece of meat bleed enough to turn your bun red? When cut should a medium prepared piece of meat leave enough speckles of blood on the plate to need to put up crime scene tape?It was enough on the rare side of \"medium\" to still be bleeding!The sandwich wasn't prepared medium is the first take home message of the story. The second take home message of the story is that the \"cook\" needs a lesson in customer service.  As I learned in my time working for the Walt Disney Company, \"the guest is not always right, but they are still our guest.\" As a server or any person who works in a service role, you will gain nothing by explaining to the customer why they are wrong and you are right especially when you don't know how to cook a medium temperature Bison Philly.Molly took 50% off my sandwich and we had a gift card so it was ~$9 each. I tipped Molly $10 as she did a great job as usual. I'll be back, but there will be a chat about how a Bison Philly should be cooked pre-order.\"\n\"I absolutely love Upland-Carmel. I frequently visited when I lived in the area, but even now that I live in Indy I always find myself going to the Carmel location!! The staff is always very nice, and for a while they remembered me and my order! The venue itself is decently sized with a really nice outdoor patio. They have really good specials, my boyfriend and I enjoy Friday's ($10 IPA pitcher) and Sunday's ($3 pints). We also ALWAYS order the nachos with chicken. I can't recommend this place enough. Their beer is my favorite around the area.\"\n\"Upland has definitely improved over time. Thankfully the issues I had in my original post were solved with employee changeover and action from manager, Allison. Finally getting around to writing a new review I so neglected doing.The beer is (of course) great and more varieties and seasonal  shave been added in on rotations. Definitely enjoy swinging by for the latest rotations to taste! I'm personally not a fan of sours but my sister is and swears that Upland's are some of the best she has had. Over time the menu gets changed with some frequency which I really love! Definitely forces me to try different things but a staple is always the soft pretzel and pimento spread! Luckily that stays on the menu all the time :)Staff is a night and day difference from all prior issues and Allison runs a smooth ship and I see her around regularly! She definitely makes sure guests are happy while letting the staff do their jobs. Whether lunch or dinner every experience I've had in the last couple years at Upland has been great, even on busy weekends!\"\n\"I'm a fan of this place! We use to come here a lot for small group lunches from my office but now that we've grown, it's hard to come to places like this because it's smaller than most restaurants. However, the food is delicious and the beers have a great following so definitely try it out if you're in the area. I got the Chicken Nachos for my lunch (on the appetizer section) and it was more than enough food. Crunchy blue corn chips and stacked with a good amount of meat. The cheese did get a bit stiff after a while. When our server first greeted us, I told him I didn't actually like beer and he made a great recommendation for a cider. Our table split the tempura cauliflower and it had a great crunch with a good kick to it. (I also recommend anything with Southwest Tofu!)\"\n]"}
{"prompt": "BASIC INFORMATION: \n{\"name\": \"Butcher and Singer\", \"city\": \"Philadelphia\", \"categories\": \"\\\"Restaurants, Steakhouses, American (Traditional)\\\"\"}\nUSER FEEDBACK: \n[\n\"I came here tonight for my son's 15th birthday. We are avid carnivores and have high standards for steak. As New Yorkers,we are pretty biased on our porterhouse and strips because we love Our NY hot spots. Anyhoo- everything was delicious- the ambiance, service, food, u name it! Perfect- it was like I was back in NYC. Try the porterhouse for 2, butcher salad and baked Alaska. The spinach and potatoes were not bad as well. Perfect place for a group to unwind as well.\"\n\"Love it. Love it. Love it.Butcher and Singer is an absolutely delicious experience. Here's a run down...1. The service is commensurate with a Classic American steakhouse. My server Ed was a true professional in every sense of the word.2. The wedge salad is better than anyone else's.3. The steaks are cooked perfectly.4. The atmosphere is so elegant , yet comfortable. Everything from the decor to the background is incredible.5. The wine list is impressive. The cocktails are somewhat imaginative twists on classics.In conclusion, this place is how a steakhouse should be. Some places seem to be trying hard to be great, while others just are great. This place simply is great.\"\n\"We decided to take my mom to Butcher and Singer for her birthday after she, my wife and sister saw a show on Broad St. We had a reservation and we're immediately seated. The interior of Butcher and Singer is high end and on par with the other Top Steakhouses in the City. As we started to review the menu we noticed something that we hadn't seen on the website earlier, Porterhouse for 1, 2 or 3. (It is there if you open the .pdf version of the menu). Considering that, along with me, my dad and future brother-in-law made up 3/4 of my party at Peter Luger's, we quickly decided to let the girl's fend for themselves and order the Porterhouse for 3, medium rare. The steak came out out perfectly cooked and tasted incredible. The meat so flavorful and tender, we completely devoured it. We even picked at the bones, much to the dismay of Amy and the Moo waiting for their doggy bags. For sides we ordered the mashed potatoes and their Signature Stuffed Hashbrown. The mashed potatoes were very good and I'd definitely recommend them. The Stuffed Hashbrown is heavily recommended in other reviews on Yelp and I had very high hopes for it. Unfortunately, I didn't think it lived up to the hype.For the rating I'm conflicted. I'm bouncing back and forth between a 4 and a 5, a 4.5 star rating just sounds right. However since Yelp won't let me do it ... I'm going with 5 stars. It wasn't Peter Luger's, but we had the conversation and made the comparison so that's why I'm rounding up. I'd definitely recommend Butcher and Singer for a Steak in Center City.\"\n\"Another restaurant week review...I know I know...This was a special evening for me and the beau.  It was our 1 year anniversary and even though our pockets have been a little light, we knew we could properly celebrate thanks to Restaurant Week.Our server was amazing.  The entire staff was pretty great.  We tried to order different things so we could get a good sampling.  I had the beet salad and he had the corn chowder for the first course.  Both were pretty solid, though we both agreed the chowder was better.  For the second course, we both got the filet, but he got the mashed potatoes and I went for the local squash.  Both sides were ok, not really flavorful or memorable.  I ordered my steak rare and he ordered his medium rare.  When we were brought the steaks, they got switched even though we restated what we ordered.  We didn't figure it out until we had already started eating.  I feel like that is a mistake that should not happen here.  Am I being picky?  Maybe.  He didn't seem to mind.  I think the way people order their steaks is so personal, so it should be correct.  I was also underwhelmed with the steak itself.  The flavor was ok, but I have had better from my mother's kitchen.  It wasn't the melty buttery flavorful bite that filet is supposed to be.  Dessert was pretty good.  The beau got the chocolate cake and though he loved it, I thought it was so so.  I loved my creme caramel, though you had to eat it with the ice cream and not as separate elements.It was a romantic night with great company, but the meal itself was a bit underwhelming.  I expected more Mister Starr.  I don't want to say who, but somewhere around the corner is serving a better piece of meat...and that place rhymes with frel disco's...just saying.\"\n\"Great great place. It's a fancy steak house but they actually try to be nice. After the requisite wait 5 minutes for your empty table reservation, everything else is snappy and good. Our waitress Jenn was really great. Not stuffy or mean, funny efficient. Delmonico steak was delicious just a tad to salty. Porterhouse was solid and perfectly cooked thanks to solid understanding from the server as to how we wanted it.  Crab cake was unexpectedly amazing. Crunchy on the outside moist on the inside. They even volunteered to accommodate dietary issues. When did that happen to you at a fancy steak house.   Baked Alaska is even good for someone that prefers chocolate. Its worth the money.\"\n\"Solid restaurant week spot.  Every year I get together with my oldest friend, Lindsey G. from Philadelphia, her mom, and my mom for a girl's night out.  Due to my yelp prowess it's my job to pick the restaurant and make the reservation.  Butcher and Singer seemed like a good pick because of it's central location, and red meat options.  We are all steak eaters.  None of us had been to Butcher and Singer before, and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal.I went with the fresh mozzarella with eggplant for my appetizer.  The mozzarella was very fresh, and pleasantly salty, with some acid cutting though the creaminess creating a very well balanced dish.  For my entree I had to do the filet.  I really only get this when it's offered at RW, and it was perfectly cooked to medium rare, and very well seasoned.  The mashed potatoes were creamy, but not overly rich.  For dessert I had the chocolate bread pudding.  Bread pudding is a favorite dessert of mine, and this one was only okay.  It needed to be warmer and more chocolatey.  The bananas on top were a nice touch though.  Service was good.  The waitress returned several times to ask how things were, and to refill drinks.  I went with the $8 cabernet that was on special.  It was very fruity for a cab, but still went well with the meal.  The interior is very dark, and we were seated on what seemed like living room chairs.  Very comfortable, but kind of low to the table.  It was also a little on the loud side.  The ceiling is very pretty.  I wasn't sure how I felt about dog murals at restaurants, but the dogs here are dressed so nicely, and look so dapper, that I have to give it two thumbs up.  Second favorite decor item was the steer head in the center of the room.  It signals to me that this is a place to order steak.  Winning.\"\n]"}
{"prompt": "BASIC INFORMATION: \n{\"name\": \"Domenica\", \"city\": \"New Orleans\", \"categories\": \"\\\"Restaurants, Italian, Pizza, Tapas/Small Plates\\\"\"}\nUSER FEEDBACK: \n[\n\"This is an excellent restaurant. John Besh nails it!They are open until 11 with full bar service, and have excellent food. Unless you sit at the bar, a reservation is recommended. Everything here has a fresh taste and Italian authenticity that you would want. Some menu items are interesting...I don't know about the fried kale salad, but the meats and cheeses are excellent. The pizzas are huge and very very good...bar service is great and the drinks are reasonable. Overall a great find, good food, and reasonable prices...this works!  Also, check out the Roosevelt hotel next door...another find!\"\n\"Still the best pizza in town! Chef Alon is a master at what he does, and they just opened a new location on Magazine at Robert Street.\"\n\"This place was amazinggg!! They were super quick getting my order out. My friend and I shared the meatballs and the white pizza which were both to die for. We also got the affogato and gianduja budino. I will definitely be back!\"\n\"Great Italian place. The food was all delicious and portions were a good size.  Focaccia and olive oil came before our meal.  We started with an arugula salad.  For entrees, we got the rabbit ragu and red snapper.  The red snapper was so flavorful. I loved the sun dried tomato sauce it came with which paired perfectly with the fish. You could tell the ragu was slow cooked and the flavors melded together well. This was my first time eating rabbit but it was pretty good. It tasted like a combination of chicken and lamb. For dessert, I tried the affogato which came with vanilla gelato and a side of espresso and biscotti. The espresso wasn't too bitter and the biscotti was a nice addition.\"\n\"Mozza in LA by Nancy Silverton and Mario Batali, Delfina SF, and Chris Bianco's Bianco in Phoenix all rank as my choice for the best pizza in America! Well enter Domenica Nola, by John Besh.My short list could also include more greats from the east  but today I have these to compare.I sat at the bar and service was amazing, friendly and informative. My choice of the Calabrese pizza was perfect. The olives and capers with the salumi with fresh Mozzarella was salty, and just what I was craving. expert charred crust with the perfect deft was on point. My server selected a great local IPA that was the perfect pair.I overheard staff chit chatting, but it was just about food, and especially beverages, this is a staff of highly trained professionals.In a city with amazing restaurants that serve great local cuisine, please don't miss a  visit to Dominica, its not cajun or creole, but it is amazing.Tomorrow Luke!\"\n\"Came in for lunch with colleagues. We ordered the mixed anitpasto which came with a blue cheese and a hard cheese, proscuitto, sopresatta and blood sausage. There was also various accompaniments and garnishes.I had the watermelon salad with feta and pickled onions.The table ordered several pizzas and lasagna. The best of the pizzas were the fennel and sausage and the wild mushroom. The lasagna was also very good.\"\n]"}
{"prompt": "BASIC INFORMATION: \n{\"name\": \"Capogiro Gelato\", \"city\": \"Philadelphia\", \"categories\": \"\\\"Coffee & Tea, Gelato, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Food\\\"\"}\nUSER FEEDBACK: \n[\n\"Who runs this place?  I want to fall at their knees and pledge eternal devotion for bringing me this wonderful place, especially for two of their flavors: lemon with opal basil, and perhaps my all-time favorite, avocado.  Their label for the avocado says \"trust us...\" and you SHOULD.  If you've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant and ordered avocado shake, this is the above-and-beyond, I died and went to Avocado Heaven version of that.  Do not miss this place if you are in Philly. Forget the frozen yogurt fad...this is bite by bite the best frozen treat bang for buck you'll ever get in your life.\"\n\"I was wandering around Rittenhouse today killing time and just kind of haphazardly was drawn to my favorite gelato place at the expense of my waistline - not complaining! I love this place because it's different and I can always try something new that sounds pretty gross and for whatever reason that is important to me. Avocado gelato, anyone? I also love coming in because after spending time in Italy and eating gelato every day, I STILL prefer Capogiro hands down. I legitimately don't know how they pack so much flavor into their product. I settled on Bananas Foster and Cioccolato Scuro and hung out by the window by myself. You might think it would be weird hanging by yourself in a gelato shop but I would think it actually might even be a good place to study during the day. Can't wait to swing by late night during the summer!\"\n\"Capogiro Gelato sells some of the most delicious and soothing gelato I've had anywhere - try the banana gelato, it's worth it! While you're at it, sample their pineapple mint flavor, it's tangy!Besides gelato, this location also offers other desserts. My friend bought a a water ice type dessert of some sort, which I tried. The first bite was a bit tart, but got used to it.This location is clean, accessible, with nice outdoor seating.\"\n\"Yah. It's all that. Hazelnut chocolate is worth the trip (and the calories) all by itself. Quality stuff to put in your mouth. But you knew that.\"\n\"Great gelato place!  Lots of different flavors, and a lot of turnaround for seasonal flavors.  I was really disappointed I missed the rose, but I will definitely be coming back to try new flavors.  Loved the tamarind - it looks like it will be bland, but it was everything but that!  It went really well with chocolate or dulce de leche.  Their dark chocolate gelato is also pretty incredible!  Super rich.  Also pretty expensive for gelato, but totally worth the price!\"\n\"Ah, Capogiro - we meet again. Always a pleasure.For this trip, I had the Mint Stracciatella (chocolate chip) and the Banana with Dark Rum. The mint was wonderful - not too sweet, mint like the plant rather than the toothpaste - with small pieces of fresh mint leaves throughout. It was green and refreshing. In addition, the banana rum was good - though it had too sweet a banana flavor for my taste, it was delightful. I brought my brother from out of town, who doesn't really like overly sweet things, and he much enjoyed the very dark chocolate one (I can't remember the name) and the Espresso and Chocolate.For my Capogiro 'Hall of Fame,' I'd say Champagne Mango with Avocado tops the charts, followed by the Mexican Chocolate, which has a touch of cinnamon and a kick of cayenne. Delicious!\"\n]"}
{"prompt": "BASIC INFORMATION: \n{\"name\": \"Su Xing House\", \"city\": \"Philadelphia\", \"categories\": \"\\\"Kosher, Chinese, Restaurants, Vegetarian, Vegan\\\"\"}\nUSER FEEDBACK: \n[\n\"The food at Su Xing House will not blow your mind.  What is great about it is that you are able to have all those wonderful feelings of eating chinese food (from your childhood) but without the meat.  Most (if not all) of their stuff seems to be vegan.  Perhaps they throw in some egg or butter somewhere but for the most part, you're good.The price point is insanely low for this section of the city.  There aren't many places with a lunch special like this one.  For a low price, you get soup, entree, rice and a spring roll, with all the tea and duck sauce you can drink.On a recent trip, I was pleasantly surprised by the lotus root soup.  I doctored it up with a bit of white pepper and it was nearly perfect.  I'm partial to the homestyle bean curd but I haven't ever gotten them to prepare me something \"spicy\"  I feel like each time I ask for it they just sort of chuckle and never actually do it.So, I've eaten here a number of times and will continue to.  It's an inexpensive lunch option and the food is tasty, in that \"I want to feel guilty about eating chinese\" way.\"\n\"I came here for lunch with my husband after I checked into our hotel. It was next to our hotel and the reviews on Yelp made it sound heavenly and it sure was. Initially we were the only customers in the restaurant but that changed soon enough. After looking at their menu I ordered the potato and cauliflower curry and my husband ordered the General Tso's tofu, both the lunch special. For appetizer we ordered the scallion pancakes. The pancakes were great. Nice and fried and came with a dipping sauce. My lunch special was okay. I much preferred my husband's and I wished I also ordered it. The potato and cauliflower was a bit bland while his tofu was crispy and delicious. The hot and sour soup and spring roll that I had with the lunch special was also delicious.Overall great place. I would definitely come again when I'm in PA. I didn't even tell my husband till the end that this was a vegetarian restaurant and he said that he didn't even miss the meat! Service was decent, especially for a Chinese restaurant. Tons of seating!\"\n\"I was on a vegan cleanse.  I needed real food.  Enter Su Xing House.  I had the Sesame Abalone Mushroom (see photo) it was divine.  Granted, I was hungry and desperate but it really was delicious.  I have also had the fried brown rice and it was also very good.  We have only really been there after matinee theater so the place has never really been crowded.  The decor is dark, cozy and the place is really clean.  I would recommend this place for a quick and quiet weekend lunch.\"\n\"so good. so very, very good.the portions are ridiculously large, the food delicious, and it's vegan! woohoo! okay, so i'm not vegan. but, i AM veggggggggietarryan, so it still jibed with my eating.el buggo digs the croquettes the most, while i am partial to the peas, potatoes and curry sauce. did i mention how very good this is?\"\n\"Although I've been a vegetarian for decades, I have never appreciated fake meat that too commonly dominates vegetarian restaurants. This is why I LOVE Su Xing.  They pay close attention to each vegetable, no dish seems to be slapped together without thought.  Servings are huge and very reasonably priced.  I love their Ebony and Ivory, Stir Fried Peapods, Seaweed Salad, I could go on and on. They also deliver until 11PM on weekends which is rare around these parts.  It always hits the spot beautifully.\"\n\"Excellent vegetarian Chinese food. And it's not often you get to say \"vegetarian Chinese food\". The menu is varied, although unlike a similar place in Hong Kong it doesn't have quite as many sea vegetables, other than a few different seaweeds. It does have a lot of different mushrooms, and they are all delicious. I had the #22, Dried Bean Curd w. Spiral Seaweed, my Wife had  the #10 As You Wish, Bean curd skin filled golden mushroom, black mushroom, dried bean curd and Chinese celery served w. water chestnut and asparagus. Both were great, although in this case I think my Wife won. The restaurant itself is very nice and surprisingly low key and upscale looking. A great, inexpensive find.\"\n]"}
